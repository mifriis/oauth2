# SOLID principles

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that help to create maintainable and scalable object-oriented software. These principles are:

* Single Responsibility Principle: This principle states that a class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility, and should not be responsible for multiple things.
* Open/Closed Principle: This principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be designed in such a way that it can be easily extended to add new functionality, without modifying the existing code.
* Liskov Substitution Principle: This principle states that derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes. This means that if a program is using a base class, it should be able to use a derived class without knowing it, and the behavior should be the same.
* Interface Segregation Principle: This principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. This means that an interface should be designed in such a way that clients only have to implement the methods that they need, rather than implementing a large, monolithic interface with many methods.
* Dependency Inversion Principle: This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions. This means that the design of a system should avoid tight coupling between modules, and instead depend on abstractions (such as interfaces) to enable flexibility and maintainability.

## Benefits

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that can help to create object-oriented software that is maintainable, scalable, and extensible. These principles can be beneficial to use in many different situations, such as:

* When working on a large software project that will be maintained and updated over time
* When working on a project with a team of other developers, and you want to ensure that the code is easy to understand and work with
* When you want to create software that is flexible and can be easily extended to add new features and functionality
* When you want to avoid common pitfalls and design problems that can lead to code that is hard to maintain and update.

The SOLID principles can be beneficial to use in any situation where you want to create high-quality, maintainable object-oriented software.

## Using SOLID to enable Unit testing

The SOLID principles can enable unit testing in several ways. 

* First, the Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility, and should not be responsible for multiple things. This can make it easier to test a class, because the behavior of the class will be more predictable and easier to understand.
* Second, the Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be designed in such a way that it can be easily extended to add new functionality, without modifying the existing code. This can make it easier to test a class, because the existing code will not need to be modified in order to add new tests.
* Third, the Liskov Substitution Principle states that derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes. This means that if a program is using a base class, it should be able to use a derived class without knowing it, and the behavior should be the same. This can make it easier to test a class, because the derived class can be used as a substitute for the base class in tests, allowing you to test the behavior of the derived class without modifying the existing code.

The SOLID principles can enable unit testing by promoting well-defined, single-responsibility classes that are easy to extend and test. This can help to ensure that your code is well-tested and free of bugs and other issues.

## When should you avoid using SOLID?

There is no specific situation in which you should not use the SOLID principles. These principles are a set of guidelines for creating maintainable, scalable, and extensible object-oriented software, and can be beneficial to use in many different situations.

However, there may be times when using the SOLID principles may not be practical or necessary. For example, if you are working on a very small software project that will not be maintained or updated over time, using the SOLID principles may be overkill. In this case, you may be able to achieve your goals without using the SOLID principles, and you may be better off focusing on other aspects of your project.

Additionally, if you are working on a project with strict time or resource constraints, you may not have the time or resources available to fully implement the SOLID principles in your code. In this case, you may need to prioritize other aspects of your project, and may not be able to fully implement the SOLID principles.

Overall, while the SOLID principles can be beneficial to use in many situations, there may be times when using these principles may not be practical or necessary. It is up to you to evaluate the specific needs and constraints of your project, and to determine whether using the SOLID principles is the right approach for your situation.
