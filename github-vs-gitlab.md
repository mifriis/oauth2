# Github vs Gitlab

Both GitHub and GitLab are web-based hosting services for version control using Git. They both provide features such as code review, collaboration, and documentation, but they have some key differences.

GitHub is the most popular Git hosting service and is widely used by open-source projects. It offers a variety of plans, including free and paid options, and has a strong focus on collaboration and community.

GitLab, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive solution that includes not only Git repository management but also a full software development lifecycle. It offers both self-hosted and cloud-hosted options, and its features are designed to support the entire development process from project planning and source code management to deployment and monitoring.

Ultimately, the choice between GitHub and GitLab depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for a simple, collaborative Git hosting service, GitHub may be the better option. If you need a more comprehensive solution that covers the entire software development lifecycle, GitLab may be a better choice.
